This project is setup to show the motivation
for creating an inheritance hierarchy.

In the MyDeviceDriver, it is not currently possible
to create an ArrayList of both MyPhone and
MyPod objects since ArrayLists can only hold
one type of an object. If we could create an 
ArrayList that could hold both types (like an
ArrayList call "shoppingCart", then
we could have one for loop that could cycle through
all devices (MyPhones and MyPods) and process
them all at once.
